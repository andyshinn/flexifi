# Flexifi Release Notes

## v1.0.1 - 2025-07-07

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Compact Interface Design**: Reduced spacing and optimized layout for captive portal environments
- **Inline Button Layout**: Moved Scan, Enter Manually, and Reset buttons inline with "Available Networks" header
- **Side-by-side Form Fields**: Labels now appear to the left of inputs for more compact forms
- **Responsive Container**: Increased container width to 600px for better text fitting
- **Smart Content Toggling**: Network list automatically hides when manual entry form is shown

### 📱 Enhanced Captive Portal Experience
- **Header Optimization**: Title and subtitle now displayed side-by-side to save vertical space
- **macOS Compatibility**: Improved layout to fit within macOS captive portal window constraints
- **Status Color Coding**:
  - Yellow background for scanning/throttled states
  - Red background for error conditions
  - Proper status preservation during operations

### 🔧 Scan System Overhaul
- **Throttling Management**: Proper 30-second scan throttling with countdown timer display
- **WebSocket + HTTP Parity**: Both connection methods now handle throttling identically
- **Improved Feedback**: "Scanning..." message during active scans instead of "No networks found"
- **Status Protection**: Important status messages no longer get overridden by network updates
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear visual feedback for scan failures and network issues

### 🌐 WiFi Connection Reliability
- **Auto-Connect Fix**: Resolved issue where devices would disconnect and fail to auto-reconnect
- **WiFi Profile Storage**: Now properly saves WiFi profiles with auto-connect enabled instead of basic credentials
- **Mode Management**: Fixed WiFi mode handling to stay in STA mode after portal stops
- **Network Cache Management**: Proper invalidation of network cache when switching modes

### 🎯 Resource Optimization
- **Portal Cleanup**: ~99% of portal resources are freed when connected and portal stopped
- **Minimal Footprint**: Only essential WiFi monitoring remains active when connected
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of WebSocket, DNS, and web server resources

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for scan operations and auto-connect behavior
- **Asset Minification**: Integrated minify-html for 26.7% reduction in web asset size (3.6 KB savings)
- **Live Preview Support**: Maintained CSS/JS external references for development testing

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **JSON Parsing**: Fixed malformed JSON responses causing "string did not match expected pattern" errors
- **Network Display**: Resolved issue where networks were found on serial but not displayed in UI
- **Status Synchronization**: Fixed WebSocket and HTTP status message consistency
- **Form Validation**: Improved error handling for network connection attempts

### 📋 Technical Details
- Proper WiFi profile creation with `autoConnect = true` and priority system
- Enhanced scan throttling with server-side timing calculations
- Improved WebSocket message handling for immediate scan responses
- Better status message hierarchy to prevent important notifications from being overridden
